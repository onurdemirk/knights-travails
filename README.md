# Knights Travails

This JavaScript function calculates the shortest path a knight can take on an 8x8 chessboard from a given start position to a given end position.

## How It Works
- Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to ensure the shortest path is found.
- Keeps track of **visited positions** to avoid unnecessary loops.
- Displays the path in a **formatted console output**.
- Works **within the standard chessboard size (0-7 coordinates)**.
